# PHPMailer Change Log

## Version 7.0.0 (October 15th, 2025)

This is exactly the same as 6.11.1 but bumps the major version number to indicate the presence of a BC break in child
classes. Specifically, `lang()`, `setLanguage()`, and `$language` are now static, and should be called statically.

## Version 6.12.0 (October 15th, 2025)
This is exactly the same as 6.10.0, reverting all the changes in 6.11.0 and 6.11.1, which inadvertently introduced a BC break affecting child classes. 6.11.1 has been re-released as 7.0.0.

## Version 6.5.0 (June 16th, 2021)
* **SECURITY** Fixes CVE-2021-34551, a complex RCE affecting Windows hosts. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.
* The fix for this issue changes the way that language files are loaded. While they remain in the same PHP-like format, they are processed as plain text, and any code in them will not be run, including operations such as concatenation using the `.` operator.
* *Deprecation* The current translation file format using PHP arrays is now deprecated; the next major version will introduce a new format.
* **SECURITY** Fixes CVE-2021-3603 that may permit untrusted code to be run from an address validator. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.
* The fix for this issue includes a minor BC break: callables injected into `validateAddress`, or indirectly through the `$validator` class property, may no longer be simple strings. If you want to inject your own validator, provide a closure instead of a function name.
* Haraka message ID strings are now recognised

## Version 6.4.1 (April 29th, 2021)
* **SECURITY** Fixes CVE-2020-36326, a regression of CVE-2018-19296 object injection introduced in 6.1.8, see SECURITY.md for details
* Reject more file paths that look like URLs, matching RFC3986 spec, blocking URLS using schemes such as `ssh2`
* Ensure method signature consistency in `doCallback` calls
* Ukrainian language update
* Add composer scripts for checking coding standards and running tests

## Version 6.4.0 (March 31st, 2021)
* Revert change that made the `mail()` and sendmail transports set the envelope sender if one isn't explicitly provided, as it causes problems described in <https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues/2298>
* Check for mbstring extension before decoding addresss in `parseAddress`
* Add Serbian Latin translation (`sr_latn`)
* Enrol PHPMailer in Tidelift

## Version 6.3.0 (February 19th, 2021)
* Handle early connection errors such as 421 during connection and EHLO states
* Switch to GitHub Actions for CI
* Generate debug output for `mail()`, sendmail, and qmail transports. Enable using the same mechanism as for SMTP: set `SMTPDebug` > 0
* Make the `mail()` and sendmail transports set the envelope sender the same way as SMTP does, i.e. use whatever `From` is set to, only falling back to the `sendmail_from` php.ini setting if `From` is unset. This avoids errors from the `mail()` function if `Sender` is not set explicitly and php.ini is not configured. This is a minor functionality change, so bumps the minor version number.
* Extend `parseAddresses` to decode encoded names, improve tests

## Version 6.2.0
* PHP 8.0 compatibility, many thanks to @jrf_nl!
* Switch from PHP CS Fixer to PHP CodeSniffer for coding standards

* Avoid warnings when using old openssl functions
* Improve Travis-CI build configuration

## Version 6.1.8 (October 9th, 2020)
* Mark `ext-hash` as required in composer.json. This has long been required, but now it will cause an error at install time rather than runtime, making it easier to diagnose
* Make file upload examples safer
* Update links to SMTP testing servers
* Avoid errors when set_time_limit is disabled (you need better hosting!)
* Allow overriding auth settings for local tests; makes it easy to run tests using HELO
* Recover gracefully from errors during keepalive sessions

* Prevent duplicate `To` headers in BCC-only messages when using `mail()`
* Avoid file function problems when attaching files from Windows UNC paths
* Improve German, Bahasa Indonesian, Filipino translations

* Increased test coverage

## Version 6.1.7 (July 14th, 2020)
* Split SMTP connection into two separate methods

* Save response to SMTP welcome banner as other responses are saved
* Retry stream_select if interrupted by a signal

## Version 6.1.6 (May 27th, 2020)

* The custom autoloader has been removed: [**use composer**](https://getcomposer.org)!
* Classes & Exceptions renamed to make use of the namespace
* Most statically called functions now use the `static` keyword instead of `self`, so it's possible to override static internal functions in subclasses, for example `validateAddress()`
* Complete RFC standardisation on CRLF (`\r\n`) line breaks for SMTP by default:
  * `PHPMailer:$LE` defaults to CRLF
  * All uses of `PHPMailer::$LE` property converted to use `static::$LE` constant for consistency and ease of overriding
  * Similar changes to line break handling in SMTP and POP3 classes.
  * Line break format for `mail()` transport is set automatically.
  * Warnings emitted for buggy `mail()` in PHP versions 7.0.0 - 7.0.16 and 7.1.0 - 7.1.2; either upgrade or switch to SMTP.

  * `POP3->POP3_PORT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_PORT` constant)
  * `POP3->POP3_TIMEOUT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` constant)
* NTLM authentication has been removed - it never worked anyway!
  * `PHPMailer->Workstation`
  * `PHPMailer->Realm`
* `SingleTo` functionality is deprecated; this belongs at a higher level - PHPMailer is not a mailing list system.
* `SMTP::authenticate` method signature changed
* `parseAddresses()` is now static
* `validateAddress()` is now called statically from `parseAddresses()`
* `idnSupported()` is now static and is called statically from `punyencodeAddress()`

* Don't try to use an auth mechanism if it's not supported by the server
* Reorder automatic AUTH mechanism selector to try most secure method first
* `Extras` classes have been removed - use alternative packages from [packagist.org](https://packagist.org) instead
* Better handling of automatic transfer encoding switch in the presence of long lines

Migrate to PHPMailer 6.0.

## Version 5.2.24 (July 26th 2017)
* **SECURITY** Fix XSS vulnerability in one of the code examples, [CVE-2017-11503](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-11503). The `code_generator.phps` example did not filter user input prior to output. This file is distributed with a `.phps` extension, so it is not normally executable unless it is explicitly renamed, so it is safe by default. There was also an undisclosed potential XSS vulnerability in the default exception handler (unused by default). Patches for both issues kindly provided by Patrick Monnerat of the Fedora Project.
* Handle bare codes (an RFC contravention) in SMTP server responses
* Make message timestamps more dynamic - calculate the date separately for each message

## Version 5.2.23 (March 15th 2017)
* Improve trapping of TLS errors during connection so that they don't cause warnings, and are reported better in debug output
* Amend test suite so it uses PHPUnit version 4.8, compatible with older versions of PHP, instead of the version supplied by Travis-CI
* This forces pinning of some dev packages to older releases, but should make travis builds more reliable
* Test suite now runs on HHVM, and thus so should PHPMailer in general
* Improve Czech translations
* Add links to CVE-2017-5223 resources

## Version 5.2.22 (January 5th 2017)
* **SECURITY** Fix [CVE-2017-5223](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5223), local file disclosure vulnerability if content passed to `msgHTML()` is sourced from unfiltered user input. Reported by Yongxiang Li of Asiasecurity. The fix for this means that calls to `msgHTML()` without a `$basedir` will not import images with relative URLs, and relative URLs containing `..` will be ignored.
* Add simple contact form example
* Emoji in test content

* Temporary fix for missing attachments

## Version 5.0.0 (April 02, 2009)
With the release of this version, we are initiating a new version numbering
system to differentiate from the PHP4 version of PHPMailer.
Most notable in this release is fully object oriented code.

### class.smtp.php:
* Refactored class.smtp.php to support new exception handling
* code size reduced from 29.2 Kb to 25.6 Kb
* Removed unnecessary functions from class.smtp.php:
  - public function Expand($name) {
  - public function Help($keyword="") {
  - public function Noop() {
  - public function Send($from) {
  - public function SendOrMail($from) {
  - public function Verify($name) {

###  class.phpmailer.php:
* Refactored class.phpmailer.php with new exception handling
* Changed processing functionality of Sendmail and Qmail so they cannot be
  inadvertently used
* removed getFile() function, just became a simple wrapper for
  file_get_contents()
* added check for PHP version (will gracefully exit if not at least PHP 5.0)
* enhanced code to check if an attachment source is the same as an embedded or
  inline graphic source to eliminate duplicate attachments

### New /test_script
We have written a test script you can use to test the script as part of your
installation. Once you press submit, the test script will send a multi-mime
email with either the message you type in or an HTML email with an inline
graphic. Two attachments are included in the email (one of the attachments
is also the inline graphic so you can see that only one copy of the graphic
is sent in the email). The test script will also display the functional
script that you can copy/paste to your editor to duplicate the functionality.

### New examples
All new examples in both basic and advanced modes. Advanced examples show
   Exception handling.

### PHPDocumentator (phpdocs) documentation for PHPMailer version 5.0.0
All new documentation

## Version 2.3 (November 06, 2008)
* added Arabic language (many thanks to Bahjat Al Mostafa)
* removed English language from language files and made it a default within
  class.phpmailer.php - if no language is found, it will default to use
  the english language translation
* fixed public/private declarations
* corrected line 1728, $basedir to $directory
* added $sign_cert_file to avoid improper duplicate use of $sign_key_file
* corrected $this->Hello on line 612 to $this->Helo
* changed default of $LE to "\r\n" to comply with RFC 2822. Can be set by the user
  if default is not acceptable
* removed trim() from return results in EncodeQP
* /test and three files it contained are removed from version 2.3
* fixed phpunit.php for compliance with PHP5
* changed $this->AltBody = $textMsg; to $this->AltBody = html_entity_decode($textMsg);
* We have removed the /phpdoc from the downloads. All documentation is now on
  the http://phpmailer.codeworxtech.com website.

## Version 2.2.1 (July 19, 2008)
* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (my apologies, error on my part)

## Version 2.2 (July 15, 2008)
* Fixed redirect issue (display of UTF-8 in thank you redirect)
* fixed error in getResponse function declaration (class.pop3.php)
* PHPMailer now PHP6 compliant
* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (endless loop from missing = sign)

## Version 2.1 (Wed, June 04 2008)
NOTE: WE HAVE A NEW LANGUAGE VARIABLE FOR DIGITALLY SIGNED S/MIME EMAILS. IF YOU CAN HELP WITH LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

* added S/MIME functionality (ability to digitally sign emails)
  BIG THANKS TO "sergiocambra" for posting this patch back in November 2007.
  The "Signed Emails" functionality adds the Sign method to pass the private key
  filename and the password to read it, and then email will be sent with
  content-type multipart/signed and with the digital signature attached.
* fully compatible with E_STRICT error level
  - Please note:
    In about half the test environments this development version was subjected
    to, an error was thrown for the date() functions used (line 1565 and 1569).
    This is NOT a PHPMailer error, it is the result of an incorrectly configured
    PHP5 installation. The fix is to modify your 'php.ini' file and include the
    date.timezone = Etc/UTC (or your own zone)
    directive, to your own server timezone
  - If you do get this error, and are unable to access your php.ini file:
    In your PHP script, add
    `date_default_timezone_set('Etc/UTC');`
  - do not try to use
    `$myVar = date_default_timezone_get();`
    as a test, it will throw an error.
* added ability to define path (mainly for embedded images)
  function `MsgHTML($message,$basedir='')` ... where:
  `$basedir` is the fully qualified path
* fixed `MsgHTML()` function:
  - Embedded Images where images are specified by `<protocol>://` will not be altered or embedded
* fixed the return value of SMTP exit code ( pclose )
* addressed issue of multibyte characters in subject line and truncating
* added ability to have user specified Message ID
  (default is still that PHPMailer create a unique Message ID)
* corrected unidentified message type to 'application/octet-stream'
* fixed chunk_split() multibyte issue (thanks to Colin Brown, et al).
* added check for added attachments
* enhanced conversion of HTML to text in MsgHTML (thanks to "brunny")

## Version 2.1.0beta2 (Sun, Dec 02 2007)
* implemented updated EncodeQP (thanks to coolbru, aka Marcus Bointon)
* finished all testing, all known bugs corrected, enhancements tested

Note: will NOT work with PHP4.
