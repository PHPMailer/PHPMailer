ChangeLog

Version 2.0.3 (November 08 2008)
* fixed line 1041 in class.smtp.php (endless loop from missing = sign)
* fixed duplicate images in email body
* removed English language from language files and made it a default within
  class.phpmailer.php - if no language is found, it will default to use
  the english language translation
* corrected $basedir to $directory
* changed default of $LE to "\r\n" to comply with RFC 2822. Can be set by the user
  if default is not acceptable
* removed trim() from return results in EncodeQP
* changed $this->AltBody = $textMsg; to $this->AltBody = html_entity_decode($textMsg);
* We have removed the /phpdoc from the downloads. All documentation is now on
  the http://phpmailer.codeworxtech.com website.

Version 2.0.2 (June 04 2008)

** NOTE: WE HAVE A NEW LANGUAGE VARIABLE FOR DIGITALLY SIGNED S/MIME EMAILS.
   IF YOU CAN HELP WITH LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, IT WOULD BE
   APPRECIATED.

* added S/MIME functionality (ability to digitally sign emails)
  BIG THANKS TO "sergiocambra" for posting this patch back in November 2007.
  The "Signed Emails" functionality adds the Sign method to pass the private key
  filename and the password to read it, and then email will be sent with
  content-type multipart/signed and with the digital signature attached.
* added ability to define path (mainly for embedded images)
  function MsgHTML($message,$basedir='') ... where:
  $basedir is the fully qualified path
* fixed MsgHTML() function:
  - Embedded Images where images are specified by <protocol>:// will not be altered or embedded
* fixed the return value of SMTP exit code ( pclose )
* addressed issue of multibyte characters in subject line and truncating
* added ability to have user specified Message ID
  (default is still that PHPMailer create a unique Message ID)
* corrected unidentified message type to 'application/octet-stream'
* fixed chunk_split() multibyte issue (thanks to Colin Brown, et al).
* added check for added attachments
* enhanced conversion of HTML to text in MsgHTML (thanks to "brunny")

Version 2.0.1 (Sun, Dec 02 2007)
* corrected incorrect version numbers in all three classes

Version 2.0.0 (Sun, Dec 02 2007)
* implemented updated EncodeQP (thanks to coolbru, aka Marcus Bointon)
* finished all testing, all known bugs corrected, enhancements tested
- note: designed for PHP4, but will work with PHP5 (not compatible with
  E_STRICT) ... full PHP5 version of PHPMailer released separately.
  PHP5 version will NOT work with PHP4.

Version 2.0.0 rc2 (Fri, Nov 16 2007), interim release
* implements new property to control VERP in class.smtp.php
  example (requires instantiating class.smtp.php):
  $mail->do_verp = true;
* POP-before-SMTP functionality included, thanks to Richard Davey
  (see class.pop3.php & pop3_before_smtp_test.php for examples)
* included example showing how to use PHPMailer with GMAIL
* fixed the missing Cc in SendMail() and Mail()

******************
A note on sending bulk emails:

If the email you are sending is not personalized, consider using the
"undisclosed-recipient:;" strategy. That is, put all of your recipients
in the Bcc field and set the To field to "undisclosed-recipients:;".
It's a lot faster (only one send) and saves quite a bit on resources.
Contrary to some opinions, this will not get you listed in spam engines -
it's a legitimate way for you to send emails.

A partial example for use with PHPMailer:

$mail->AddAddress("undisclosed-recipients:;");
$mail->AddBCC("email1@anydomain.com,email2@anyotherdomain.com,email3@anyalternatedomain.com");

Many email service providers restrict the number of emails that can be sent
in any given time period. Often that is between 50 - 60 emails maximum
per hour or per send session.

If that's the case, then break up your Bcc lists into chunks that are one
less than your limit, and put a pause in your script.

* added Estonian language file by Indrek P&auml;ri

  example of use:
  $mail->set('X-Priority', '3');
  $mail->set('X-MSMail-Priority', 'Normal');
* fixed warning message in SMTP get_lines method
* added TLS/SSL SMTP support
  example of use:

  //$mail->SMTPSecure   = "ssl";  // option
